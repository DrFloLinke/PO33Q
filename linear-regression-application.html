<h2>The Basic Command<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-basic-command"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>The command to run a regression in R is beguilingly simple:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb48"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">regression</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/stats/lm.html">lm</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">devar</span> <span class="op">~</span> <span class="va">indepvar</span>, data<span class="op">=</span><span class="va">dataframe</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We specify an object into which we store the results of the regression, here <code>regression</code>, and assign a function to this object called <code>lm</code> which stands for “linear model”. It is then convention to state the dependent variable first in the command, which in our case will always be democracy. This is then followed by a tilde and the independent variable which you want to include.</p>
<p>In the case of modernisation theory, you might want to test what influence per capita GDP has on democracy. This week we are using the Polity V scale to measure democracy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ‘Polity Score’ captures [the] regime authority spectrum on a 21-pont scale ranging from -10 (hereditary monarchy) to +10 (consolidated democracy). (…) The Polity scheme consists of six component measures that record key qualities of of executive recruitment, constraints on executive authority and political competition. It also records changes in the institutionalized qualities of governing authority.”<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;For more detail see &lt;a href="http://www.systemicpeace.org/polityproject.html" class="uri"&gt;http://www.systemicpeace.org/polityproject.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>and then load the <a href="files/Downloads/Europe.csv">Europe.csv</a> data set into the workspace. We subset this data frame to observations from the year 1994, only. Yes, I know it’s a long time ago, but I need an example that works for everything I want to show you this week.</p>

<p>Our dependent variable is called <code>polity5</code>. The independent variable is called <code>gpdpc</code>. We are now ready to run our first regression:</p>

<p>Let’s deal with the last step first. The number of observations is equal to the number of countries in this case. We have subset the data to the year 1994, and so we have 28 countries in the analysis. This seems trivial for now, but it will become important later on. Once observations are missing, R drops them from the analysis – especially in developing countries where data are often missing in large quantities this can lead to a rapid decimation in the number of observations. This in turn is problematic for the strength inference we can draw from the analysis.</p>

<div id="the-all-important-p-value-in-regression" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>The all-important p-value in Regression<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-all-important-p-value-in-regression"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<div class="video">
<p><strong>The p-Value</strong></p>
<p>YouTube link to follow</p>
</div>
<p>It might seem odd to focus on the p-value before interpreting the coefficients substantively, but this is precisely what you have to do in practice, as well. If a regression coefficient is insignificant, then we have failed to reject the null hypothesis, and have no evidence for a relationship. This is it. This is all you can say. Should this happen to you in the assessment, please do not engage in speculation of “had the coefficient been significant, then it would suggest that…”. No. There is no relationship. State that, and move on. Only if there is a relationship you can move on to interpreting the coefficients substantively.</p>
<div class="warning">
<p>If you interpret insignificant coefficients substantively (other than that there is no relationship) in the assessment you will lose marks.</p>
</div>
<p>But how do you assess significance? We do a regression in order to ascertain whether there is a relationship between the independent and the dependent variable, or not. For testing whether there is one, we start from the assumption that there is none. This is what we call the null hypothesis; in our example here it would be that per capita GDP does not influence the level of democracy in a country.</p>
<p>Now, remind yourself of the normal distribution from the video which has the mean age in its centre. In the video we were interested whether age influences height. Assuming, that there is no relationship between age and height, a regression line would look as follows:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:flatreg"></span>
<img src="images/Week%202/height_line.png" alt="\label{fig:flatreg}Flat Regression Line" width="50%"><p class="caption">
Figure 19: Flat Regression Line
</p>
</div>
<p>The line is perfectly flat (the slope coefficient is zero), intercepting the y-axis at the mean. It does so, because the regression line is the value of y we would expect on average for a given x. If this value does not vary, it has to be the average of y. If we now put a zero slope coefficient, such as the one for height, just in the more general form of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{2}\)</span> in the centre of a normal distribution, it looks like this:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:betanull"></span>
<img src="images/Week%202/beta2_plot.png" alt="\label{fig:betanull}Null Hypothesis for $\beta_{1}$" width="50%"><p class="caption">
Figure 20: Null Hypothesis for <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{1}\)</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>What we want to test now, with regression, is whether the slope coefficient R has calculated for us (let me denote the estimated value of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{1}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta_{1}}\)</span>), is far enough from this mean of zero, to say that we can be sure to say that there <em>is</em> a relationship.</p>
<p>The statement that there <em>is</em> a relationship between the independent and the dependent variable, is called the alternative hypothesis. In our case the alternative hypothesis would read: “The level of per capita GDP influences the level of democracy in a country”.</p>
<p>So how far away from the centre of zero do we have to go to say that there is indeed relationship, or put differently, that we have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis? The standard in political science is that we need to have a 5% probability of finding a value more extreme than the one we have observed. Under the curve in the following graph, that is equal to the orange area on the right. And that is the p-value.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:pbeta"></span>
<img src="images/Week%202/beta2_highlight.png" alt="\label{fig:pbeta}p-value for $\beta_{1}$" width="50%"><p class="caption">
Figure 21: p-value for <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{1}\)</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>If this area is 5% or less, then we have observed a value for the slope coefficient which is so far away from our assumed mean of zero, that we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.</p>
<p>But now, you might say, a slope coefficient can also be negative – here we are only looking at the right hand-side, and therefore at the scenario in which a slope coefficient is positive. And you are right. The scatter plot could give us a negative line. So, if we want to move away far enough from the assumed mean of zero in the centre, we must do so in both directions, to the left and to the right. Now, we need a value that is so far out, that to either side of the distribution, 2.5% of the area are left under the curve (2.5% on the left plus 2.5% on the right make the overall 5% we are interested in). We call this a two-sided test, whereas the scenario above is a one-sided test. The p-values reported by R for the slope coefficients are always two-sided tests (unless we tell R not to, but we are not doing that on this module). This value gives us the area under the normal distribution to the left and the right beyond our observed value, as shown in this figure:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<span style="display:block;" id="fig:twobeta"></span>
<img src="images/Week%202/beta2_twotail.png" alt="\label{fig:twobeta}Two-Sided Test for $\beta_{1}$" width="50%"><p class="caption">
Figure 22: Two-Sided Test for <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{1}\)</span>
</p>
</div>
<p>The value we are looking at in R to determine the p-value, is in the column <span class="math inline">\(Pr(&gt;|t|)\)</span>.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="files/Week%202/pvalue.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>In order to satisfy the requirement of the p-value being 5% or less, this value needs to be smaller than 0.05. Otherwise, more than 5% area are left, and we are not certain enough that our value is far enough away from the zero mean in the centre to say that it is “statistically different” from it. When we look at the value for the slope coefficient <code>gdppc</code> here, 0.00212, this means that the areas on the left and the right are jointly 0.21% – small enough for us to be sure to have found a value that is far enough away from zero to claim that there is a relationship. We therefore reject the null hypothesis: we find evidence for a relationship between per capita GDP and Polity V in Europe in the year 1994 Again, if we want to visualise this, the actual p-value of <span class="math inline">\(0.00212\)</span> would look like this:</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<div class="inline-figure"><img src="files/Week%202/intercept.png" width="75%" style="display: block; margin: auto;"></div>
<p>R always shows the value for the intercept in the intuitively labelled row “(Intercept)” and the column “Estimate”. In this case the value is 6.1. What does this coefficient mean, substantively? When you remember the graph depicting the regression line, this is the point where the line intercepts the y-axis. So, it is the value of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, here democracy in the form of the Polity V score, when <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, here economic development in the form of GDP, is zero. So in other words, a country with a GDP per capita of zero would achieve a Polity V score of 6.1. The substantive interpretation sometimes makes sense (like here), but sometimes cannot be interpreted in this way.</p>

The <span class="math inline">\(e-4\)</span> means that we have to move the decimal point 4 units to the left, so written fully, this means <span class="math inline">\(0.0001377\)</span>. We interpret it as follows: for every additional unit of per capita GDP, measured in US$, the Polity V score increases by <span class="math inline">\(0.0001377\)</span>, on average. This seems very small, but when you consider the size of GDP per capita in many countries, it seems logical that this value is as small as it is. If the coefficient was negative, then this would mean that for for every additional unit of per capita GDP, measured in US$, the Polity V score would decrease by <span class="math inline">\(0.0001377\)</span>, on average.</p>

<p><strong>Interpreting a coefficient</strong></p>
<p>The order in which to interpret a coefficient is as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Is it significant? If not, all you can say is that there is no influence. There is insufficient evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.</li>
<li>If it is significant, you can interpret its size and direction according to the statistical model (for example, slope coefficent vs. partial slope coefficient).</li>
<li>What does the coefficient mean for the hypothesis? Look at the direction. Is the direction as predicted by the hypothesis? Then you have evidence to support the hypothesis. If the direction is inverse, then you have falsified the hypothesis, even though you have a significant coefficient.</li>

<p>As you have seen in the video, the goodness of fit is a measure to indicate how much of the variation in the dependent variable (democracy) the independent variable (per capita GDP) is explaining. For this, we take the ratio of the explained sum of squares over the total sum of squares. The resulting percentage is R<span class="math inline">\(^2\)</span>, also known as the
<span class="gls"><a href="https://drfloreiche.github.io/PO33Q/glossary-2.html">coefficient of determination</a></span>. This number can also be found on the R output, and is in our case <span class="math inline">\(0.3092\)</span>, or 30.92%. This value is not too bad for a single variable! The maximum we can explain is of course 100% with an R-Squared value of 1.0, even though this is a dream never achieved empirically. But we are still quite some distance of this dream, and can probably do better. There surely must be factors other than per capita GDP that explain democracy in Europe in the year 1994.</p>

<p>Yes, you can! And this is where the fun starts, because now we are getting a step closer to the real world. New modernisation posits that democracy is multi-causal, and does not rest on the influence of GDP alone. Instead, it puts forward a number of concepts that act as independent variables, one of which is health. We can measure health through Hospital beds (per 1,000 people), and include this in our model, on top of GDP. To do this we type:</p>

<p>Let us focus on the coefficient for gross primary school enrolment first. Its value is rounded <span class="math inline">\(1.476e-01\)</span>, or <span class="math inline">\(0.1476\)</span>, implying that for every additional percent of gross primary school enrolment, the Polity V score increases by <span class="math inline">\(0.1476\)</span> units on average. So far, so good, but as we have included other variables in the regression model, namely per capita GDP, we need to account for this fact in our interpretation. We do this by adding “all other things being equal” (Latin:
<span class="gls"><a href="https://drfloreiche.github.io/PO33Q/glossary-2.html">ceteris paribus</a></span>) to this interpretation. What does this mean? It means, that if we take into account the level of per capita GDP, and hold this level constant, then for every additional percent of gross primary school enrolment the Polity V score increases by <span class="math inline">\(0.1476\)</span> units on average. As such, we force the regression model to isolate the effect of gross primary school enrolment, by including other possible explanatory factors, such as per capita GDP. You will sometimes read this in articles in the form of “controlling for”. As the percentage of gross primary school enrolment only explains the Polity V score partially now, the coefficients in a multiple regression model are also known as
<span class="gls"><a href="https://drfloreiche.github.io/PO33Q/glossary-2.html">partial slope coefficients</a></span>.</p>
<p>To give you a different example: suppose we want to find out whether sex influences income. We could simply run a regression with income as the dependent variable, and sex as the independent variable. But we also know, that age influences income, as with increasing age people have more experience which is reflected in their salary. So even though we are not interested in the amount age influences income, we would include it in the regression model, so as to isolate the effect of the variable we are interested in: sex.</p>
<p>Back to our modernisation example and school enrolment. The p-value for this coefficient is <span class="math inline">\(0.02979\)</span>, and therefore well below the required 5% threshold. We can conclude that the percentage of gross primary school enrolment influences the level of democracy in Europe in the year 1994. Per capita GDP remains significant.</p>

<div id="parsimony" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>Parsimony<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#parsimony"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>But can you just add independent variables at your leisure? The short answer is no. The long answer is: parsimony. This means “as few as possible, as many as necessary”. The “necessary” component is guided by the theoretical underpinning of your investigation. For example, you subscribe to new modernisation theory, and believe that that it is not only economic development in the form of per capita GDP that determines the level of democracy, but that indicators of social change also play an important role. Now it is your job as a researcher to decide how we measure social change. Do we include health? And if so, how do we measure it, say by number of hospital beds per person? Should we choose a different measure for education that measures educational outcomes more directly than enrolment? Then we might decide on literacy. But are these two enough to measure social change, or do we need to look at other facets? We seek to include as few as possible to produce an empirical picture of social change, but so many that we are doing proper justice to the theory.</p>
<p>We can then proceed to test different scenarios. For example, does economic development already explain democracy? What happens if we add social change? Or does social change explain democracy on its own, already? These questions lead to the topic of “model specification”, which we will discuss in greater detail in week 4.</p>

<h3>R-Squared Again<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#r-squared-again"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>As soon as we introduce more than one independent variable to the model, we cannot use “Multiple R-Squared” any more. The reason is that this measure cannot properly take into account added variables. It will either stay the same, or increase, it cannot decrease. This of course, makes no sense, for example if we add average shoe size in 1994 to the analysis, this would not help to explain democracy, but Multiple R-Squared would still likely go up. We therefore need a new measure, called <span class="gls"><a href="https://drfloreiche.github.io/PO33Q/glossary-2.html">Adjusted R-Squared</a></span> which not only penalises us for adding more independent variables, but will also decrease if a variable takes explanatory power away from a model.

<p>OLS is a great method to model the relationship between one or multiple independent variables on a dependent variable. But this only works for cross-sectional data. OLS cannot deal with
<span class="gls"><a href="https://drfloreiche.github.io/PO33Q/glossary-2.html">time-series data</a></span> a condition that is crucial when we want to model the emergence and survival of democracy.</p>
<p>Why? There is a bunch of assumptions that need to be satisfied in order for OLS to deliver us with accurate results, collectively known as the Classical Linear Assumptions (CLM). One of these is that the error terms (our <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_i\)</span>s) are not correlated with one another. This assumption is rarely met in time series data, as for example the Polity V score does not miraculously begin to dependend on the percentage of gross primary enrolment in a given year. It will also depend to an extent on the percentage of gross primary enrolment in the previous year, and indeed on the Polity V score of the previous year. This would cause <span class="gls"><a href="https://drfloreiche.github.io/PO33Q/glossary-2.html">autocorrelation</a></span> in the error terms which is bad news for the CLM.</p>
<p>As such, you will not be able to use linear regression in this format in the final assessment!</p>

<p>I have discussed linear regression with you this week for two reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>I am trying to sketch the methodological development through which the relationship between economic development and democracy has been analysed over time. <span class="citation">Lipset (1959)</span> started with a simple correlation analysis, and this quickly developed into linear regression analysis, as it is more powerful and more sophisticated than correlation analysis.</li>
<li>It forms the foundation for the binary response models (probit in our case) which we will start with next week. To start with, we will only look at the probability to be democratic in a particular year across different countries. But in Week 7, we will extend this to not only investigate this relationship across countries, but also over time. This dynamic probit, or Markov Transition Model (MTM), is the model you need to apply in the assessment of the module. Please DO NOT stick to linear regression in the assessment, as OLS is not capable to deal with time-series data. The same applies for a cross-sectional probit. The only method permissible in the assessment is an MTM.</li>
